# P2-project

Here is our P2 project - A larger program developed by a group!

## Purpose

That the student learns how to use programming and associated model formation in problem solving. The aim is also to gain further experience in problem-oriented project work in a group in natural progression from the 1st semester.

## Why

The project work focuses on acquiring programming skills and associated model formation in connection with problem solving. The project work must thus ensure that the students achieve a common foundation in programming that can be utilized in subsequent semesters. Project work must include essential concepts about algorithms, data structures and / or computer networks. The project work also focuses on gaining experience with problem-oriented project work in connection with programming.

# Learning Objectives

## Knowledge

-   Algorithmic concepts that are relevant to the project's problem solving
-   Distributed solutions within computer networks that are relevant to the project's problem solving
-   Concepts, structures and facilities of the programming langugage used
-   Testing of programs, including unit testing

## Skills

-   Delimit and define a problem within a given area
-   Design a well-structued solution
-   Implement a larger program of high quality
-   Incorporate concepts and techniques in algorithmics and computer networks that are relevant to the project
-   Test the program to ensure that the program is correct
-   Apply version control to manage parts of the application in the development process
-   Be able to understand and explain what project management is

## More skills

-   Define a problem and within this problem formulate and defend a problem that can be solved using programming
-   Develop a model that can be used in connection with the solution of the chosen problem
-   Complete the work leading up to a viable and demonstrable program
-   Describe how the program solves a formulated problem within the context of the problem
-   Involve relevant practical and social aspects of solutions in computer science and software technology
-   Describe, reflect on and analyze the experiences gained with problem-oriented project work in a group

# Teaching method

Project work supported by the courses in the semester and digital learning resources in testing, version control and program design. In the middle of the project period, a status seminar is held, where the project group presents its problem formulation, work results and experiences with the work process.
